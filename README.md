Blind spots in the eye or cornea area are a common symptom of several eye
illnesses that are prevalent nowadays. Several factors, including ageing, negligent
upkeep, pollution, accidents, etc., are to blame for this. In order to eliminate the
blind spots, this results in corneal transplantation. The cornea is punctured by the
endothelial punch after the eye is severed since the donors are deceased persons.
The cornea is then separated. However, the receiver's eye is more difficult to
remove since it is attached to the optic nerve, making it more difficult. The
project's primary emphasis is on a challenging procedure termed cornea surgery
on a human eye. In accordance with the requirements of the specific patient, the
cornea is to be sliced. Because even a tiny difference in microns of length could
result in eye sight damage, doctors are unable to be as precise when employing a
trephine punch with their hands. Consequently, the machine possesses the most
precise motor achievable, which also has a microns measure of perfection. The
standards for being accepted of medical practises are closely adhered to, and the
body weight and built quality are both maintained. The design and safety of the
human eye are governed by numerous emergency security measures. The
solenoid, trephine punch, and case that make up the trephine assembly mostly
travel along its horizontal axis. The object can be moved horizontally with the
help of the stepper motor and drivers. To adjust the features, such as speed,
distance, and height, stepper motors and drivers are employed. The main axis of
motion for the trephine assembly, which also includes a solenoid, a trephine
punch, a lead screw, a ball screw, lead screw supports, and a case, is horizontal.
The two core elements of linear motion systems are the motor, which converts
electrical energy into rotating motion, and the lead screw mechanism, which
transforms the rotational motion of the motor into linear motion.
